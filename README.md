## Project Insight
- Based on the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn:
- A potential price increase of 25% is feasible based on historical sales trends.
- To mitigate risks, a conservative price increase of 10-15% is recommended.
- A segmented pricing strategy can enhance customer retention and maximize revenue.

## Final Conclusion:
- Conservative Increase:
Test a 10-15% price increase to assess market response.
For example, if the 2022 price was $4.99:
A 10% increase would raise the price to approximately $5.49.
A 15% increase would set the price at about $5.74.

- Market Analysis:
 Conduct further research on customer satisfaction and competitive pricing.
Monitor the overall economic environment to fine-tune pricing strategy.
Segmented Pricing:
 Differentiate pricing for casual and registered users based on price sensitivity.

- Monitor and Adjust:
Implement the new prices with a plan for continuous monitoring and adjustment based on customer feedback and sales data.
